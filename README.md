## Drum 🥁 Kit

This is a simple web-based drum kit application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on the drum buttons or using their keyboard.

## Features

Interactive Buttons: Each button corresponds to a specific drum sound.
Keyboard Support: Users can press keyboard keys (W, A, S, D, J, K, L) to play the drum sounds.
Visual Feedback: Button animations are triggered when a key is pressed or clicked. 

## How It Works

The app listens for button clicks and keyboard presses using JavaScript event listeners.
When a button is pressed or clicked, a corresponding drum sound is played.
The app also includes a simple animation that highlights the pressed button for a brief moment.
